#### Passive Income

- +50 Passive Income

#### Commander Upgrade
By default, the player starts out with no commander. They can hire one through this tree, and upgrade their stats individually. Commanders boost the chance of winning skirmishes, and slightly boost morale of the soldiers, increasing the soldier skill stat chance by half of its level.
Commanders have a chance to fight opposing commanders (if both players have a commander) during skirmishes. This initiates a manual battle between the 2 commanders, and whoever wins will win the battle with their chosen outcome.
##### Commander Health
The health of the commander. 
##### Commander Armor
The armor of the commander. 
##### Commander Damage 
The damage of the commander.
### Recruit Army
8000 for +1 Army
    
## Battle

        - Player gains 250-500 dollars 

### Weapon Failure
    The complexity of a player's weapon both helps them in battle but also raises the risk.
    A player's weapons are capable of failing during battle, which can cause 1 of 3 outcomes: 
        - Player loses the battle and flees with one less army and a range of cash between 500-1000
        - Player manages to win by a thread and only have to pay 500-1000 dollars
        - The battle was devastating. Player loses 1300-2000 dollars, 2 armies, and a weapon tech level
